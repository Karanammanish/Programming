//Some more method
//this methods will be usefull for large array

let nums = [45,56,43,12,67,09];
//print value one by one

//forEach() will give us the value one by one 
//Better that "for of"

nums.forEach((n) =>{
    console.log(n);  //Here n will take the value from nums
});  //so here we need to define function inside the function

//forEach is very usefull set and maps
