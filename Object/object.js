//objects{Most important thing}


//object literal

let alien = {
    name: 'manish',
    tech: 'JS',
} //THis is the object

console.log(alien);

//Now you want only name then

console.log(alien.name) //any value you want then ".key"
console.log(alien['tech']) 

//.operator is better but [] has its own advantage for example input given user

//IN object you have key and value {key:value}
